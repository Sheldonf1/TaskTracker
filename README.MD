Task: 
Create a task from scratch using Html, Css, then add javascript for the application in order to add tasks, edit tasks, save tasks and delete tasks.

This will also need to be Tablet & Mobile responsive.

Add a ReadMe file describing the process you had to go through when building the application. Also add a section talking about some errors you had and how you solved those errors.

Add JS validation to ensure that the user is entering valid input. 
The userâ€™s should have a local file can be JSON or Txt File to The users data should be written to a local file. 

Problems:

The whole project TBH. I spent hours watching and coding along with multiple tutorials and hours of reading, and I still don't truly understand it. I wanted to try to use MongoBD, it is a database that is more flexible, and can take in a lot more information that the local storage. It is also much quicker and still uses JSON. Understanding each component was and is the most difficult part that I faced. This was a tough one.
